No Stubs is a blog about testing.

My name is [Sam](http://sweeneysam.com).  I currently work at Google's L.A. office and previously worked at Uber and Wealthfront, where I learned to love testing.  This blog is meant to explore topics related to testing in software development.

Hopefully you'll find something new or interesting on here.  Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk testing or write a guest post (email address in the footer).  Enjoy, and happy testing!

P.S. Thanks to [Ryan](https://www.github.com/ryanbahniuk/) for coming up with the name for this site and to [TLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrLequ6dUdM) for inspiring Ryan (RIP Left Eye).
